# Really Radical Recipes

Users can search for recipes by typing in one or multiple ingredients and a carousel populated with images and titles appears, allowing the user to select a recipe of their choosing.
After selecting a recipe the user is brought to a page containing a summary of the recipe, a short list of ingredients, and a link to a detailed full recipe.
